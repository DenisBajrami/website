Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly bullish on a key technical chart following 
its strong move above $4,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value first 
teased bullish reversal on Dec. 17 with the creation of an âoutside reversalâ 
candle on the widely followed 3-day chart. The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish 
trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through.
BTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term.

Confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart 
above,Â where the last candle has endedÂ well above $3,590 âthe high of Monday’s 
outside reversal candle.Other technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. 
For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.

View

1. A bullish reversal is confirmed on the three-day chart.
2. BTC could extend the ongoing rally to $4,400 in the next few days.
3. A daily close below $3,633 would abort the bullish setup, although the probability 
of a bearish close happening in the near term is low.
